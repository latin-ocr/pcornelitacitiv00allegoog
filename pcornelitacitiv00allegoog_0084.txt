A GERMAN GRAMMAR FOR SCHOOLS AND C OL-
LEGES, by WILLIAM Coox and E. S. SHELDON of Harvard College.

This Grammar is intended to be simple enough for boys and girls
who have never studied any other language than their own, but it will,
at the same time, call attention to kindred usages in French and the
classical languages, —— with which college students have already some
familiarity, — and thus render the acquisition of German easier to
these latter. It is intended to be the first and the last grammar in the
student's hands,— not only to teach him the first elements of the lan·
guage, but to serve continually afterwards as a work of reference while
reading or writing German.

It will aim, in the first place, at greater clearness, and then at
greater completeness, than the grammars now generally studied. Suit-
able use will be made of Lehmann's works on the language of Lessing,
Goethe, etc„ of the articles on grammatical points in the Archiv fte'r
das Studium der neueren Sprachen, of the authors’ memoranda made
while reading many different German books with college classeS, and
of the dictionaries—especially the Dictionary of the Main Difficulties
of the German Language — of the authors’ valued correspondent,
Professor Daniel Sanders.

The alphabetical index will be made up by the authors themselves,
and contain, it is hoped, every single topic in the text. Should space
anow, exercises on the plan of Heyse'S, consisting, that is, of German
sentences containing grammatical mistakes, will be introduced into
the body of the text. The Prefixes and Suffixes, the Particles, the
Modal Auxiliaries, and the order of the different elements of the
Sentence, will be treated with especial care. On these and other sub-
jects of more than usual difficulty or importance to the average student,
the authors invite suggestions, [In preparation.
