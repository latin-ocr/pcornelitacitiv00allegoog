organized province.

13. Bona fortunaeque: the manuscript reading is quite unin-
telligible3 bona fortunae quae in tributum aggerat annus iia

pears to be the best. Annus is used for the yearly produce3 see
Germania, Chap. 14.

15. θυιιωὶθηᾶὶε, constructing roads through. The Roman mili-
tary roads were constructed with such solidity that they were like a
fortification‚ and the word regularly used for making roads was

of purchase‚ and then applied to the objects conveyed by this for-
mality‚ was in later times used especially for slaves. — semel, only
once.

18. familia: i.e.‚ of slaves3 a common use of the word.

T rinobantes3 Calgacus, however, mentions the Brigantes of N orth-
ern Britain, probably as being better known to the Caledonians.

29. libertatem: the manuscripts have in libertatem. By this
expression he means that the Caledonians will not sink into supine-
neSS, socordia, as the Britons had done3 paenitentiam means

‘⁴ change of purpose.'’
