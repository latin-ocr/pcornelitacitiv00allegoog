iv Introduction.

the events of the years 68 and 69 in the HistorieS‚ appears to
be that of an eye-witness3 if so, we cannot suppose him to
have been less than fifteen at that date. Another consideration
is that Tacitus was praetor ΑΛ). 88, which was the first year he
could have held that office, under the rules of the Republic, if
he had been born in 51. These rules were„it is true, no longer
in force3 nevertheleSS, it is reasonable to suppose that they
still exerted some influence, and that this office would not be
held much before the traditional age. It may be added that
Pliny was probably not far from fifty-five when he made use of
the expression propemodum aequales ,· and that this term might
apply very well to two men of fifty-five and sixty-three or five.
He probably died about Λα). 1 16.

Of the events of his life very little is known. He married the
daughter of Agricola in the year A.D. 78 (Chap. IX.), and it
has been conjectured that he was. a member of his military
family during his administration of Aquitania the three previous
years, He was praetor A.D. 88, and was afterwards absent from
Rome for four years, during which period his father-in-law died,
Λα). 93 (Chap. XLV.). He was consul under Nerva, Aa). 97.
We learn from several passages ln Pliny that he was a distin-
guished lawyer and orator, as well as historian.

It is almost by accident that we possess the writings of Taci-
tuS, for the manuscripts in which they have come down to us
are very few, and badly mutilated. These writings are ε 1. The
Dialogue qs Orators (De Oratoribus), an early composition, so
different in style from his later works that many have thought
it could not have been wn‘tten by him. 2. 272e life qs Agn'·
cola. 3. Germany .· a description of the nations of Germany,
which forms our best source of information as to their early
condition. It is about as large a work as the Agricola. 4. The
