5. The Annalr .· properly an introduction to the Histories, less
full and minute, but in a more finished and maturet style. It
consisted of sixteen books, and embraced the period from the
death of AugustuS, ΑΛ). 14, to that of Nero, A.D. 68. Four

Tacitus was in theory a republican, and had no liking for the
empire. He knew very well that the Republic could never be
restored, and was satisfied that the beneficent rule of Nerva and
Trajan had solved the problem of ,government for the RomanS,

that when engaged in the prosecution of a cruel and unjust
,provincial governor, he spoke eloquentissime et, quod eximium
orationi q‘us inest, ‹reparas—which last word we may render,
“in a stately, earnest style.” As a writer, he had the same char-

repaid for his efforts by the intrinsic excellence of his writingS.
