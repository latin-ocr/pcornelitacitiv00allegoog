aediles, magistrates of high rank3 so, in modern timeS, burning by
the common hangman.

23. in comitio ae foro. The comitium was the upper part of
the forum, towards the Capitoline mount: the words in foro are
added to indicate the publicity of the act.

2. 1. sapientiae, philosophy. — professoribus, in the modern
meaning of the word. The teachers of philosophy were banished
about A.1). 94. —omni bona arte: this relates to the same act, —-
by the banishment of the professors, every high aspiration in art
and science was driven into exile.

9. saeculi, a cycle of yearS‚ originally identified with the long·
est age of a man, which was reckoned to be 100 years (Mommsen,
Rbmztrche Chronologzle, p. 174). It is used here in a more gen·
eral sense, age, and especially as the reign of a given prince. - Nerva
caesar. Nerva reigned from September, 96, to January, 983 the
use of this expression shows that this work was composed in his
reign3 for if he had died, he would have been called ‘⁴ Divus
N erva.‘' The same thing is shown by the use of the perfect tense,
miscuerit.

10. miscuerit. Tacitus generally uses the subjunctive after
quamquam. —prineipatum, the office of prince or emperor, mon-
arclzy3 this mixture of royalty and liberty makes a constitutional
monarchy.

12. Nerva Traianae. Trajan was adopted by Nerva, and asso·
ciated with him in the empire in September, 97, adding the name of
Nerva to his own. This expression, therefore, taken in connection
with Nerva Caesar above, shows that this work was written at some

time between September 18, 97, and January 27, 98.
