A GE OME T R Y FOR BE GINNERS.

Adapted to Lower and Grammar Sehool Work. By G. A. HILL‚
Harvard University.

The principles which underlie the method employed in this work
are the following :—

1. Geometrical instruction for beginners should proceed from the
concrete to the abstract.

2. It should aim to develop the geometric imagination and the
inventive faculty, by making reasonable demands upon the mental

powers of the learner.
3. 1t should be practical, —that is to say, it should seize every
fitting opportunity to illustrate and explain the uses of Geometry.
