The [ΛΤΒ of Agricola. 63

CHAPTER XLIV.

28. Gaio Caesare: this was the emperor Caligula3 his third
consulship was A.D. 40, that of Collega and Priscus was A.D. 93.

29. quarto: the manuscripts read V10‚ which, as is easily seen,
does not correspond to the dates of his birth and death. The mis-
take is one very easily made.

27. 1. quant-um ad gloriam, sc. attinet.

3. consulari: this is the manuscript reading, which many
change to consularibus. But he did not enjoy the consularia
ornamenta (see note, Chap. XL.)‚ but the consular dignity itself,
and was therefore consularis.

6. incolumi dignitate: see in the next chapter, the indignities
which followed soon after his death.

8. sicuti . . . ita. although . . . yet. The words non licuit are
not found in the manuscripts.

10. augurio votisque: these words describe his sagacity in
foreseeing the coming man, and the earnestness of his desires.

CHAPTER XLV.

15. obsessam curiam: this fact is not known from any other
source.

16. eadem strage: z'.e., with one another.

18. Carus Metius : MetiuS, MessalinuS, and Baebius were
notorious delatores or informers under Domitian. —intra Albanam
arcem: i.e.‚ in a villa of Domitian, situated here, where he often
summoned the Senate.

Ι 20. nostrae manus = nos senatores. —Helvidiumt this was
a son of Helvidius PriscuS, mentioned in Chap. ΙΙ.

, 21. Maurici Rusticique: these were two brothers belonging to
the Julian gens. — visus is, by zeugma, subject of perfudit (= per-
culit).

23. Senecio: see Chap. 11.

32. ejus: Tacitus passes here from address to narration.

28. 3. ante quadriennium: Tacitus was praetor A.D. 88, and
appears to have left Rome the next year for some office in a province.
He returned to Rome shortly after the death of Agricola.
