THE LETTERS OF THE YOUNGER PLINY.

Edited for Use in Schools and Colleges by TRACY PECK‚ Professor
of Latin in Cornell University.

This edition will contain all the letters of Pliny, including the cor·
respondence with the Emperor Trajan, and a commentary upon the
entire series. The slight attention paid to these letters in our Latin
courses has often been remarked and regretted. The light which
they throw upon the public and private history of their time, the ami-
able and cultivated character of the writer, and their graceful style

and exquisite Latinity, make them exceptionally instructive and inter-
esting. . [In preparation.

LA TIN PR ONUNCIA TI ON.

A Brief Outline of the Roman, Continental‚ and English MethodS,
by D. B. KING‚ Adjunct Professor of Latin in Lafayette College.

Contains a few explanatory and historieal paragraphs on the ·

Roman, Continental, and English methods of pronouncing Latin, and
a brief presentation of the main features of each, prepared for use at
Lafayette College, where the character and arrangement of studies in
English and Comparative Philology make it desirable that students
should have a knowledge of both Roman and English methods.

The students are carefully taught in practice to use the English
method, and to give the rules for the sound of the letters, this having
been found a valuable aid in teaching English Pronunciation and the
Philology of the English language. A knowledge of the Roman
method, giving the sounds, in the main, as we believe Cicero and ⁶
Virgil gave them, is required as a matter of historical information and
culture, and as an important aid in determining the derivations of
words and laws of phonetic change, and in illustrating the principles
of Comparative Philology. Mailing price, 15 cents, [Ready. .
