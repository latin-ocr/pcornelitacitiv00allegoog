The szfe of Agricola. 57

3 5. equitum turmae: turma is the term regularly used for a
division of Roman cavalry. It is used also, however, as a general
term for the cavalry of other nationS, and is to be understood here
of the Caledonians. Agricola's cavalry, consisting of auxiliarieS,
is spoken· of in the next chapter as alae, the regular expression for

auxiliary cavalry.

22. 2. recentem terrorem, etc.: the war-chariots at first
caused some confusion among the assaulting party (the Romans),
but soon became useless on the hilly ground, and mixed in with the
thick ranks of their own countrymen3 hostium must, from Tacitus'
point of view, be the CaledonianS.

4. minime equestris: the ground not being suited to horseS‚
this battle of the war-chariotS, which would properly be ranked with
cavalry engagementS, became minime equestris. The same ex-
pression, minime equestria more pugnae, is used by Livy (xxii.
47) with reference to the battle of Cannae, where, as here, the horse
became useless from the closeness of the action and the nature of
the ground.

5. aegre clivo astantes: the manuscripts read egra diu aut
stante3 manifestly corrupt. Kritz reads olivo instantem Halm
and Draeger, adstantes. It will be noted that in the round hand
of the manuscripts oliv could be easily mistaken for diu. This ap-
pears to refer to the Caledonians; while the following indicative
clause, ac saepe ...incursabant, describes both parties. In this
difficult passage, Kritz (following Wex) reads aequa nostrie for
equestres of the manuscriptS‚ and instantes for aut stante,
making the confusion refer to the Romans. It is evident‚ however,
from the following chapter, circumire terga vincentium, that the
Romans were successful so far, and were making their way trium-
phantly up the hill. The events of the battle had been as follows:
first, the skirmishing ominum next, the assault made by the Bata-
vians and Tungrians3 third, the joining of the war-chariots in the
battle, after the cavalry had been routed (Interim . . . haerebant).
Then follows a description of the mixed nature of the battle (mini-
meque . . . impellerentur), and the confusion caused by the
frightened horses (ao saepe . ..incursabant).

CHAPTER XXXVII.

9. qui adhuc: this clause is restrictive, — those Britons wite,
etc·
