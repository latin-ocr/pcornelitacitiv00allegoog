About seventy easy and well-graded lessons, both Greek and Eng-
lish, introduce the pupil to the first book of Xenophon's Anabasis‚
from which the Ρ Exercises and Vocabularies are mainly selected.
vDefinite directions have been given in regard to the amount of the
Grammar to be learned. The main aim has been, while introducing
the simplet principles of syntax, to have the pupil master the Inflec-
lions and acquire a Vocabulary. In furtherance of this purpose, the
exercises on the inflections have been increased, while those on syntax
have been decreased. Vocabularies have been given under each
lesson; and, in order to aid the pupil in memorizing thern, some
insight has been given into the derivation and into the composition of
words, — how they are built up, by means of significance endings, from
noun and verb stems, and from roots. The Prepositions are introduced
from the first; and the pupilis taught the primary meanings‚ and then
how these meanings are modified by the cases before which the Prep-
ositions stand. Questions for Review and Examination as in the first
edition. In rewriting these Lessons, considerable use has been made
of the excellent exercises, used in most of the German gymnasiums,
prepared by Dr. Wasener to accompany the Greek Grammar of Pro·
fessor Curtius. [Ready in June.
