lee Lg'fe of Agricola. 53

fifteenth century. As to the locality, it is plain from the expres-
sion praemissa classe, ete.‚ that the scene of the battle was near
the sea-shore. At any rate, it is far from likely that Agricola
reached a point so far north asthe Grampian Hi11s; and moreover
the battle would not receive its name fr0m a great range of moun·
tainS‚ but stom some moderate hill which the enemy had invested,
—- quem hostis iam insederat.

10. pugnae prioris: i.e., of the former year3 Chap. XXVI.

15. cruda ao viridis senectus: this phrase is taken from Ver-
gil, AEn. vi. 304. .

16. decora. badges os honor.

CHAPTER XXX.

21. animus, confidence.

23. nullae ultra terrae: i.e., for refuge.

28. in nostris manibus: contrasted with those Britons by
whom in the previous battles certatum est.

²9· eoque: this is the manuscript reading, which has been
altered into iique, on the ground that their nobility was no reason
for their occupying the penetralia of Britain. But if we consider
nobilissimi to be used in its primitive sense, as relating to birth, we
shall see that the purest born, the autochthons, would naturally be
in ipsis penetralibus siti.

30. servientium: i.e., the GauIS‚ who were subject to Rome.

32. terrarum ac libertatis extremost one of Tacitus’ nervous
expression5‚ — the remotest on tlte earth, and tlte last refuge of free
dom. For the nationality of the Caledoniam, see note on Chap. XI.

33. sinus famae: this figure is taken from the smus or pouch
made by a sold 1n the toga, and is best explained as meaning the
obscurity qf their fame5 recessus ao sinus may be regarded as a
kind of hendiadyS, — the obscurity of fame resulting from distance.

34. Atque omne ignotum, etc.: as long as we were unknown,
we were dreaded. But now that we are reached, this dread can no
longer exist, for there is no other nation beyond uS, which can take
our place.

18. 3. defuere terrae: they have no more lands to conquer.

8. imperium is to be joined with appellant3 this sentence is a
powerful example of Tacitus' sententious eloquence, as indeed is the
whole speech of Calgacus·
